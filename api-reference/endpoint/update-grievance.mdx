title: 'Update Grievance Status'
openapi: 'PATCH /grievances/{id}'
---

Updates the status of an existing grievance in the CPGRAMS simulation system. This operation is typically performed by officers or administrators. The `id` parameter specifies the unique identifier of the grievance to update. The request body must include the new `status` and can optionally include a `comment` explaining the status change and an `assigned_to` field to reassign the grievance to a different officer.
