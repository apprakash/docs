## Welcome to CPGRAMS API

This documentation covers the API endpoints for a simulation of CPGRAMS (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) in India. The API allows developers to create users, submit grievances, and interact with the grievance redressal system.

This API is part of the OpenNyAI Maker Residency 2025 program that aims to reimagine public grievance redressal in India by building interoperable, user-centric, and scalable digital solutions.

## Core Features

The API currently supports the following core features:
- User management (creation and authentication)
- Grievance submission and tracking
- Basic workflow operations

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

### Getting an API Key

To use the CPGRAMS API, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Visit [https://grm-unkey.vercel.app/](https://grm-unkey.vercel.app/)
2. Log in to the platform
3. Create a new API key

By default, the generated API keys have access to all available APIs in the system. Include your API key in the Authorization header of your requests as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Design Principles

This API follows these key design principles:
- **Human-Centered & Inclusive**: Built around actual user journeys
- **Open Source**: Encouraging reuse and adaptation across contexts
- **Scalable & Interoperable**: Ready for integration into CPGRAMS and beyond
- **Responsible AI**: Prioritizing ethics, equity, and data protection
