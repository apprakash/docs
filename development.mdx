  **Prerequisites**: 
  - Node.js (version 14 or higher)
  - A code editor of your choice
  - API key for the CPGRAMS Simulation API
</Info>

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your development environment for working with the CPGRAMS Simulation API:

### 1. Clone the Example Repository

We provide a starter repository with example code to help you get started quickly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opennyai/cpgrams-simulation-examples.git
cd cpgrams-simulation-examples
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Configure Your API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key:

```
CPGRAMS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CPGRAMS_API_URL=https://api.cpgrams-simulation.opennyai.org
```

## API Endpoints

The CPGRAMS Simulation API provides the following key endpoints:

### User Management

```bash
# Create a new user
POST /users

# Get all users
GET /users

# Get a specific user
GET /users/{userId}

# Update a user
PUT /users/{userId}

# Delete a user
DELETE /users/{userId}
```

### Grievance Management

```bash
# Submit a new grievance
POST /grievances

# Get all grievances
GET /grievances

# Get a specific grievance
GET /grievances/{grievanceId}

# Update a grievance
PUT /grievances/{grievanceId}

# Assign a grievance to an officer
POST /grievances/{grievanceId}/assign

# Update grievance status
POST /grievances/{grievanceId}/status
```

### Webhook Notifications

```bash
# Register a webhook URL
POST /webhooks

# Get registered webhooks
GET /webhooks

# Delete a webhook
DELETE /webhooks/{webhookId}
```

## Running the Example Applications

The example repository includes several sample applications demonstrating different use cases:

```bash
# Run the citizen portal example
npm run citizen-portal

# Run the officer dashboard example
npm run officer-dashboard

# Run the analytics dashboard example
npm run analytics-dashboard
```

Each application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Building Your Own Applications

You can use the CPGRAMS Simulation API to build your own applications for the Maker Residency 2025 program. Here are some recommended frameworks and libraries:

### Frontend Frameworks

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces
- **Angular**: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications

### Backend Frameworks

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework

### Mobile Development

- **React Native**: A framework for building native mobile applications
- **Flutter**: Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication and Security">
    - Always store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code
    - Use environment variables to store sensitive information
    - Implement proper error handling for API requests
    - Consider implementing rate limiting in your application
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Experience">
    - Design for inclusivity and accessibility
    - Support multiple languages, especially Indian regional languages
    - Provide clear feedback on form submissions and errors
    - Implement responsive design for mobile users
    - Consider offline support for areas with limited connectivity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimization">
    - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
    - Minimize API calls by batching requests when possible
    - Optimize images and assets for faster loading
    - Use pagination for large data sets
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Rate Limiting">
    The CPGRAMS Simulation API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. If you receive a 429 Too Many Requests response, you should implement exponential backoff in your application.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example of exponential backoff
    const fetchWithRetry = async (url, options, retries = 3, backoff = 300) => {
      try {
        return await fetch(url, options);
      } catch (err) {
        if (retries === 0) throw err;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoff));
        return fetchWithRetry(url, options, retries - 1, backoff * 2);
      }
    };
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues">
    If you're experiencing authentication issues, check the following:
    
    1. Ensure your API key is correct and not expired
    2. Verify that you're including the API key in the correct format (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`)
    3. Check that your API key has the necessary permissions for the endpoints you're accessing
  </Accordion>
