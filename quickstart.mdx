### API Access and Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API key">
    To access the CPGRAMS Simulation API, you'll need an API key. During the Maker Residency onboarding process, you will receive your unique API key. If you haven't received your key, please contact the program coordinators.
    
    Your API key should be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Make your first API call">
    Once you have your API key, you can make your first API call. Here's an example using curl to get the list of users:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
      https://api.cpgrams-simulation.opennyai.org/users \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```
    
    Or using JavaScript fetch:
    
    ```javascript
    fetch('https://api.cpgrams-simulation.opennyai.org/users', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
