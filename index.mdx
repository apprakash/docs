## Overview

The OpenNyAI Maker Residency 2025 is a two-month hybrid program that culminates in a five-day in-person sprint (June 2â€“6, 2025, Delhi). It is designed to reimagine public grievance redressal in India by building interoperable, user-centric, and scalable digital solutions. The residency is co-hosted with the World Bank's CivicAI Collaborative and supported by partners such as DARPG, the World Bank, and Agami.

## Vision

The residency aims to demonstrate how grievance redress systems can be:

- **Integrated** with grassroots and community platforms
- **Responsive** to citizen voices in multiple formats and languages
- **Data-driven** in surfacing systemic issues
- **Collaborative**, leveraging the strengths of the broader ecosystem

## Core Focus Areas

Teams will work on building tools and systems to:

- Expand grievance intake from diverse, underrepresented communities
- Improve grievance categorization, triaging, and routing
- Enable citizen- and GRO-facing dashboards for transparency
- Integrate voice-based, multilingual, and inclusive tech interfaces
- Surface grievance data as early indicators of governance failures

## Design Principles

- **Human-Centered & Inclusive**: Built around actual user journeys
- **Open Source**: Encouraging reuse and adaptation across contexts
- **Scalable & Interoperable**: Ready for integration into CPGRAMS and beyond
- **Responsible AI**: Prioritizing ethics, equity, and data protection
- **Maker-First**: Centering builders, civic technologists, and justice innovators

## CPGRAMS Simulation API

As part of the residency, we have developed a simulation API that mimics the functionality of CPGRAMS (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) in India. This API allows developers to:
